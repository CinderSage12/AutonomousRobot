# AutonomousRobot
This project involves building an autonomous robotic car that travels between two points using sensors and microcontrollers. The Raspberry Pi Pico serves as the main control unit, running MicroPython to manage localization and decision-making processes. An Arduino Uno controls the motors, following instructions from the Raspberry Pi Pico. The robot uses a NEO-6M GPS module to determine its position and an MPU9250 for orientation, providing accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer data. These sensors ensure the car stays on the correct course towards its destination. The motors adjust speed and direction in response to commands from the Raspberry Pi Pico. The main challenges include GPS accuracy in areas with weak signals and achieving smooth motor control. This project demonstrates how the integration of sensors and microcontrollers allows efficient autonomous navigation.
